# WebFlux-JWT-RoleBase
Securing WebFlux project with Spring Security JWT token, Role base. This project is a demo for testing JWT with Spring WebFlux. 

The catch is that, it is not using any db. It is using hardcoded user data. I'll implement that sooner or later and push that too!

The explanation and implementation in details is here: [medium_link](https://ard333.medium.com/authentication-and-authorization-using-jwt-on-spring-webflux-29b81f813e78).
